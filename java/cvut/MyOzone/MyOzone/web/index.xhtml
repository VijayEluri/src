                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <h3>Purpose:</h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this very simple JavaEE application is to
                    provide a extensible environment to analyze cell phone service
                    company account statements to get a better overview of how
                    exactly are the money and time spent.
                </p>
                <h3>Reason:</h3>
                <p>
                    I personally find the native application developed by the company
                    as very nice, although I'm missing some very interesting features
                    such as per-phone-number analysis. Forutnatelly, it is possible
                    to download a XLS sheet with the account statement data and
                    therefore this is the open door to develop a new application to
                    process this file and calculate all the interesting statistics.
                </p>
