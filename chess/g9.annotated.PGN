1.e4 
{B00 King's Pawn Opening. The King's Pawn opening move is both popular and logical. It controls the center, opens lines
for both the Queen and the Bishop, and usually leads to an open game in which tactics, rather than slow maneuvering,
predominates.} 
1...e5 
{C20 King's Pawn Game. Black responds symmetrically, making a direct challenge to the central squares.} 
2.Nf3 
{C40 King's Knight Opening. With the possible exception of :2. f4, this is the most logical second move against Black's
symmetrical answer to the King's Pawn. The Knight attacks e5, clears the way for an eventual castle and rests on its best
defensive square.} 
2...Nf6 
{C42 Petrov's Defense. The Petrov Defense continues the symmetry of the first moves, which Black must soon vary in
recovering his pawn. Often drawish if White so chooses, this defense is still favored by grandmasters for its tactical
possibilities.} 
3.Bc4 
{C42 Petrov's Defense / Italian Variation.} 
3...Bc5 
{Out of Opening Book. Nxe4 would have been in the Petrov's Defense / Italian Variation book opening. Slightly better is
Nxe4.
